		;ALP TO FIND nCr
; NOTE THAT FORMULA FOR nCr IS n!/r!(n-r)!
; so in total 3 factorials and one division.
; note that RESULT  register serves 2 functions. one as the temporary register for multiplication operations
; and one for the final division result.
;IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO WITH MULTIPLE LOOPS BUT YOU ARE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE
;OF SUBROUTINES. THAT IS EXPECTED HERE
